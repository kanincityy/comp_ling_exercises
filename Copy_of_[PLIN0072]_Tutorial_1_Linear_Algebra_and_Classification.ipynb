        "Remember that with a multinomial logistic regression classifier, we generally compute a value $z_i$ for each class and then pick the class that maximises $z_i$ (after passing it through the softmax function). For example, if we have three classes, then we have a different set of weights $w_0^{(i)}, w_1^{(i)}, w_2^{(i)}, ..., w_n^{(i)}$ for each class $i=1,2,3$ and we can compute $z_i$ as follows:\n",

This results in a $1\\times 3$ matrix $Z$ that contains the $z_i$ for each class and we just have to pass these values through the softmax function to obtain a classification.\n",
